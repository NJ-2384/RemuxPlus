Remux + is a Graphical User Interface bassed upon the open source FFmpeg project made using
CustonTkinter package in python.


It eleminates the use of a command line to process videos using FFmpeg in a modern esque GUI which
helps to improve the efficiency of small niche projects.


I developed this software as a i was in need of a very niche software which catered to my need of
processing my youtube videos.


with this software i not only try to easy my problem but also hope to help the few that wish to do
the same processing on a video but lacks the technical skills to do so.
